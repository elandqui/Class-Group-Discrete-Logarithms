cgdl6.cc: This program applies the Self-Initializing Quadratic Sieve (SIQS), with the "large prime" speed-up, to compute the discrete logarithm in the ideal class group of a quadratic order, based on Michael Jacobson's doctoral dissertation. To run this, NTL needs to be installed.

walk2.C: this program applies a random walk in the ideal class group and sets up a binary search tree to find relations of almost-smooth ideals using large primes. The program finds the solution of a discrete logarithm.

These programs are joint work with Jonathan Webster under the direction of Dr. Andreas Stein while Jonathan and I were graduate research assistants at the University of Illinois in 2002.
