This program applies the Self-Initializing Quadratic Sieve (SIQS), with the "large prime" speed-up, to compute the discrete logarithm in the ideal class group of a quadratic order, based on Michael Jacobson's doctoral dissertation. To run this, NTL needs to be installed.

This program is joint work with Jonathan Webster under the direction of Dr. Andreas Stein while Jonathan and I were graduate research assistants at the University of Illinois in 2002.
